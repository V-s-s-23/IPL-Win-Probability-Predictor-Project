# IPL-Win-Probability-Predictor-Project

# Overview :- 

In this project, i make a model thats predict the winning probability of team. this project includes feature engineering,data cleaning,Data Preparation and model building.

# About dataset :- 
 
 Dataset includes following features:
 
 1    match_id         
 2   inning

# Model_building:-
   Model building includes-
 - logistic regression.
 - columntransformer .
 - pipeline.
 - onehotencoder
 - for model evaluation ->  accuracy_score
